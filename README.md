# pegasos
An implementation of the Pegasos algorithm with hinge loss: "a simple and effective stochastic sub-gradient
descent algorithm for solving the optimization problem cast by Support Vector
Machines (SVM)" (Shalev-Shwartz et al.).

# About
Read the original paper on the Pegasos (Primal Estimated Sub-Gradient Solver for SVM) [here](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/papers/ShalevSiSrCo10.pdf).

# Implementation
The algorithm was implemented in Python, and the Perceptron and Average Perceptron algorithms were also implemented as a comparison. Some functions for bag-of-words functionality are included as wel.
